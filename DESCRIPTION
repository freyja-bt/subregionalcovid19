Description: A package to extract, clean and map recent subnational level data on active COVID-19 cases across multiple countries. Provides tools to extract and clean data from multiple data sources; and tools to visualize, via mapping, the data in terms of per capita active infections; or as the risk (%) that one or more individuals in a group of a particular size are infectious.
