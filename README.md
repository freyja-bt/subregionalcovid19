# subregionalcovid19

This repository serves as a framework to assemble and visualize recent case data from regional data sources across the globe. The package was assembled by researchers at the Georgia Institute for Technology and the Applied Bioinformatics Laboratory, and forms a core component of exposure risk calculations used in the [COVID-19 Event Risk Tool](https://covid19risk.biosci.gatech.edu/).

We compile data from a variety of [sources](https://github.com/sjbeckett/subregionalcovid19/blob/main/DataSources.md). We note that we remain neutral with respect to jurisdictional claims.
